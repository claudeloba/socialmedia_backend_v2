The final assignment for Backend 2 was to create a social media app.
Something I have previously built a couple of times.
Therefore, to challenge myself this time, I decided to try and revisit and old project I barely have any recollection of, and refactor and add features to the old project to meet the new criteria. One of them being migrating from a MySQL to a MongoDB-database.
[Old Codebase](https://github.com/claudeloba/Social-Media-App).

This is the first time I actually revisit an old project I barely remember.
I feel this will be more authentic to real-life work experience, where focus will lie on maintainance rather than having the luxury of starting from scratch each time with out-of-the-box functional npm package versions and freedom to do whatever you would like.

I expect to meet a lot of bugs and broken code along the way, and hopefully this will make me a better developer and improve my debugging skills.

I will start with writing the tests and implement a TDD-approach to my code to hopefully have a functional app at the end of it.
